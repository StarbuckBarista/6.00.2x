# Exercise 2

Please help the burglar out! For each of the following greedy metrics, what should be the burglar's first two choices of items? Here's a table of the items from the slides:
item | $ | kg | $/kg
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
clock | 175 | 10 | 17.5
picture | 90 | 9 | 10
radio | 20 | 4 | 5
vase | 50 | 2 | 25
book | 10 | 1 | 10
computer | 200 | 20 | 10

For this problem, assume that the maximum weight the burglar can carry is 20.
