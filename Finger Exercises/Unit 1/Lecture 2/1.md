# Exercise 1

Here is the [lecture from 6.00.1x on generators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLWn90kEYMk). Additionally, you can also take a look at Chapter 8.3 in the textbook.

For the following problem, consider the following way to write a power set generator. The number of possible combinations to put n items into one bag is ***2<sup>n</sup>***. Here, items is a Python list. If need be, also check out the [docs on bitwise operators](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators) (<<, >>, &, |, ~, ^).
```Python
# generate all combinations of N items
def powerSet(items):
    N = len(items)
    # enumerate the 2**N possible combinations
    for i in range(2**N):
        combo = []
        for j in range(N):
            # test bit jth of integer i
            if (i >> j) % 2 == 1:
                combo.append(items[j])
        yield combo
```
As above, suppose we have a generator that returns every combination of objects in one bag. We can represent this as a list of 1s and 0s denoting whether each item is in the bag or not.

Write a generator that returns every arrangement of items such that each is in one or none of two different bags. Each combination should be given as a tuple of two lists, the first being the items in bag1, and the second being the items in bag2.
```Python
def yieldAllCombos(items):
    """
      Generates all combinations of N items into two bags, whereby each 
      item is in one or zero bags.

      Yields a tuple, (bag1, bag2), where each bag is represented as 
      a list of which item(s) are in each bag.
    """
```
Note this generator should be pretty similar to the `powerSet` generator above.

We mentioned that the number of possible combinations for N items into one bag is ***2<sup>n</sup>***. How many possible combinations exist when there are two bags? Think about this for a few minutes, then click the following hint to confirm if your guess is correct. Remember that a given item can only be in bag1, bag2, or neither bag -- it is not possible for an item to be present in both bags!

```Python
def yieldAllCombos(items):
    """
        Generates all combinations of N items into two bags, whereby each 
        item is in one or zero bags.

        Yields a tuple, (bag1, bag2), where each bag is represented as a list 
        of which item(s) are in each bag.
    """
    N = len(items)

    for i in range(3 ** N):
        bagOne, bagTwo = [], []

        for j in range(N):
            if (i // 3 ** j) % 3 == 0:
                bagOne.append(items[j])
            elif (i // 3 ** j) % 3 == 1:
                bagTwo.append(items[j])

        yield bagOne, bagTwo
        
```
